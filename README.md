# CS360-NMF-Project
The repo contains material and code for the topic of Non-Negative Matrix factorisation. The repo was created as a part of the CS360 Machine Learning Course at IIT Goa. As part of the project the team studied Non-Negative Factorisation and prepared material including code implementation of the algorithm and simple applications to text and images.
